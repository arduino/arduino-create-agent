gc = std  # Type of garbage collection. std = Normal garbage collection allowing system to decide (this has been known to cause a stop the world in the middle of a CNC job which can cause lost responses from the CNC controller and thus stalled jobs. use max instead to solve.), off = let memory grow unbounded (you have to send in the gc command manually to garbage collect or you will run out of RAM eventually), max = Force garbage collection on each recv or send on a serial port (this minimizes stop the world events and thus lost serial responses, but increases CPU usage)
