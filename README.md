The Arduino Create Agent is a single binary that will sit on the traybar and work in the background. It allows you to use the [Arduino Create applications](https://create.arduino.cc) to seamlessly upload code to any USB connected Arduino board (or Yún in LAN) directly from the browser.

## Installation

Get the [latest version](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/releases) of the Agent for all supported platforms or complete the [Getting Started](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome).

## Apple silicon support

The Arduino Agent is supported both on Intel and Apple silicon computers. This includes devices with the M1, M2 and M3 processors.  
The Arduino Agent is built both for Intel architectures and Apple silicon devices, but distributed as a single universal executable for macOS.

### Submitting a pull request

We are glad you want to contribute with code: that's the best way to help this software.

Your contribution is adding or modifying existing behaviour, please always refer to an existing issue or open a new one before contributing. We are trying to use [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in the near future: please add one or more tests that prove that your contribution is good and is working as expected, it will help us a lot.

Be sure to use `go vet` and `go fmt` on every file before each commit: it ensures your code is properly formatted.

Also, for your contribution to be accepted, every one of your commits must be "Signed-off". This is done by committing using this command: `git commit --signoff`

By signing off your commits, you agree to the following agreement, also known as [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/): it assures everyone that the code you're submitting is yours or that you have rights to submit it.

## Authors and acknowledgment

arduino-create-agent is a fork of @[johnlauer](https://github.com/johnlauer)'s [serial-port-json-server](https://github.com/johnlauer/serial-port-json-server) (which we really want to thank for his kindness and great work)

The history has been rewritten to keep the repo small (thus removing all binaries committed in the past)
