arduino-create-agent
====================

The Arduino Create Agent is a single binary that will sit on the traybar and work in the background. It allows you to use the [Arduino Create applications](https://create.arduino.cc) to seamlessly upload code to any USB connected Arduino board (or YÃºn in LAN) directly from the browser.

## Architecture
```

## Installation
Get the [latest version](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/releases) of the Agent for all supported platforms or complete the [Getting Started](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome).

## Apple M1 support
At the moment the new Apple Silicon Macs released in November 2020, like the new [MacBook Pro 13"](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/), [MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) and [Mac mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/) models with the [Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/) chip are currently NOT supported by the Create Agent.

### Submitting a pull request
We are glad you want to contribute with code: that's the best way to help this software.

Your contribution is adding or modifying existing behaviour, please always refer to an existing issue or open a new one before contributing. We are trying to use [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in the near future: please add one or more tests that prove that your contribution is good and is working as expected, it will help us a lot.

Be sure to use `go vet` and `go fmt` on every file before each commit: it ensures your code is properly formatted.

Also, for your contribution to be accepted, every one of your commits must be "Signed-off". This is done by committing using this command: `git commit --signoff`

By signing off your commits, you agree to the following agreement, also known as [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/): it assures everyone that the code you're submitting is yours or that you have rights to submit it.

## Authors and acknowledgment
arduino-create-agent is a fork of @[johnlauer](https://github.com/johnlauer)'s [serial-port-json-server](https://github.com/johnlauer/serial-port-json-server) (which we really want to thank for his kindness and great work)

The history has been rewritten to keep the repo small (thus removing all binaries committed in the past)
